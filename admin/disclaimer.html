                <h2>5. Not a Professional Service</h2>
                <p>Overland East Bay is a community group, not a professional guiding service, outfitter, or mechanical
                    shop. We do not provide professional certifications or guarantees of safety.</p>

                <h2>6. Environmental Responsibility</h2>
                <p>We advocate for the "Tread Lightly!" principles. Participants are expected to respect public and
                    private lands, stay on designated trails, and pack out all trash.</p>
