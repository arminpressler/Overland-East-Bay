        <h2>Common Vehicle Issues on the Road</h2>

        <h3>Tire Damage</h3>
        <p>The most common issue on the trail is tire damage. Sharp rocks, thorns, sidewall cuts, and slow punctures are
            inevitable. Running lower pressures for traction
            increases sidewall vulnerability. Unrepaired damage leads to blowouts, and finding replacement tires in your
            size internationally can be challenging.</p>

        <p class="what-to-do"><strong>What to do:</strong> Best to be prepared with quality tires, have a repair kit,
            and know how to use
            it.</p>
        <img src="/images/maintenance-tire-repair.jpg" alt="Field Tire Repair"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

        <h3>Electrical Problems</h3>
        <p>Overlanding puts unique stress on vehicle electrical systems. Battery drain from accessories, corroded
            connections from water crossings, and vibration-loosened wiring are frequent culprits. Symptoms include
            moisture, and constant vibration creates the perfect storm for electrical gremlins.</p>
        <p class="what-to-do"><strong>What to do:</strong> Know your system and bring a voltmeter for basic
            troubleshooting.</p>

        <h3>Suspension and Steering Components</h3>
        <p>The added weight of overlanding gear and rough terrain accelerate wear on suspension components. Worn
            bushings, leaking shocks, and loose ball joints develop faster than during normal driving. You'll notice
            roads.</p>
        <p class="what-to-do"><strong>What to do:</strong> Regularly inspect and be sensitive to new noises and road
            feel to detect issues
            early.</p>

        <h3>Cooling System Failures</h3>
        <p>Slow speeds in hot climates, clogged radiators from dust and debris, and the strain of carrying heavy loads
            under the hood. A failing water pump or collapsed radiator hose can strand you in remote areas.</p>
        <p class="what-to-do"><strong>What to do:</strong> Especially in hot deserts or high altitudes, keep a careful
            watch on your
            gauges.</p>
        <img src="/images/maintenance-engine-check.jpg" alt="Engine Check"
            style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">

        <h3>Fuel System Issues</h3>
        <p>Contaminated fuel is a reality in many remote regions. Water in diesel, sediment in fuel tanks, and clogged
            fuel filters cause rough running, power loss, or complete failure to start. The constant jostling also
            loosens fuel line connections and can damage fuel pumps.</p>

                When things do break, which they will, staying calm and being creative is the key to get back on the
                road.
            </p>
        </section>

        <h3>The Duct Tape and Wire Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Successful overlanders master the art of "good enough for now" repairs. The goal isn't perfection but getting
            safely to the next town with proper facilities. Carry multiple types of tape (duct, electrical, self-fusing
            silicone), wire in various gauges, zip ties in multiple sizes, and hose clamps ranging from small to large.
        </p>

        <h3>Radiator Hose Emergency Fix</h3>
        <p>When a radiator hose splits or develops a leak, drain the cooling system if possible. Clean and dry the
            damaged area, then wrap it tightly with self-fusing silicone tape, overlapping by half the tape width. Cover
            this with several layers of duct tape. For larger splits, insert a piece of aluminum can as a shim before
            wrapping. This can hold for hundreds of miles if done properly. Monitor temperature closely and refill
            coolant as needed.</p>

        <h3>Fuel Line Repairs</h3>
        <p>For cracked or damaged fuel lines, cut out the damaged section if you have spare hose. If not, clean the area
            thoroughly with fuel to remove oil and dirt. Wrap the crack tightly with self-fusing tape, then secure with
            multiple zip ties pulled very tight. For fuel filter issues with contaminated fuel, improvise a filter using
            clean cloth or coffee filters in an emergency, though this is temporary at best.</p>

        <h3>Electrical Quick Fixes</h3>
        <p>For loose or corroded connections, clean contacts with a wire brush or sandpaper, then protect with
            dielectric grease or petroleum jelly. Bypass blown fuses temporarily with wire for non-critical circuits to
            diagnose problems. For chafed wires, separate them from sharp edges using split garden hose or foam pipe
            insulation, then wrap with electrical tape.</p>

        <h3>Suspension Limping Solutions</h3>
        <p>A broken leaf spring can be temporarily splinted using wood planks, metal bars, or even multiple layers of
            strong sticks bound tightly with wire or ratchet straps alongside the spring pack. This won't restore full
            capability but allows slow progress. For broken shock absorbers, remove them entirely rather than leaving
            them flopping around causing damage.</p>

        <h3>Exhaust System Repairs</h3>
        <p>Exhaust leaks sound terrible but rarely stop you completely. For holes in pipes or mufflers, stuff the hole
            with steel wool, then wrap with aluminum flashing or cut-up cans, securing with wire or hose clamps. The
            repair will be loud but functional. For broken hangers, wire coat hangers, baling wire, or even strong rope
            can hold exhaust components in place temporarily.</p>

        <h2>Parts Sourcing</h2>

        <h3>Before You Leave: Critical Spares</h3>
        <p>Research your vehicle's known weaknesses and carry those specific parts. Essential spares include all filters
            (oil, fuel, air), all belts, extra fuses and relays, brake fluid, spare bulbs, gasket material, and hoses
            that fit your coolant system. Also pack vehicle-specific items like glow plugs for diesels or ignition
            components for older vehicles.</p>

        <h3>Universal Parts Strategy</h3>
        <p>Some parts are universally available worldwide. Standard-size hose clamps, basic electrical connectors,
            generic fuel filters, and common oil filters can be found almost anywhere. Learn the specifications of your
            parts so you can find equivalents. Carry adapters or fittings that let you use non-standard parts in a
            pinch.</p>

        <h3>Finding Parts in Remote Areas</h3>
        <p>Local mechanics often have creative solutions and access to regional parts sources. Agricultural equipment
            dealers carry robust parts that may work as substitutes. Mining operations, construction sites, and truck
            repair facilities in remote areas often have heavy-duty components adaptable to overlanding vehicles.
            Shipping yards and industrial areas are goldmines for improvisation materials.</p>

        <h3>International Shipping Options</h3>
        <p>DHL, FedEx, and UPS operate in most countries but expect customs delays and hefty fees. Ship to major cities
            rather than remote areas. Some overlanders use general delivery at post offices or ship to embassy/consulate
            addresses with prior permission. Online communities often coordinate parts mules, where traveling
            overlanders carry parts for stranded vehicles.</p>

        <h3>Local Fabrication</h3>
        <p>Welding shops, machine shops, and metal fabricators exist even in small towns throughout the developing
            world. They can manufacture brackets, repair cracked housings, or fabricate replacement parts from drawings
            or the broken original. Labor is often inexpensive, and craftsmen are remarkably skilled at improvisation.
        </p>

        <h3>Online Resources and Communities</h3>
        <p>iOverlander, Horizons Unlimited, and various Facebook groups connect overlanders worldwide. Post your
            location and needs, and often someone nearby has spare parts or can point you to local sources. Some popular
            routes have established networks of overlanders who cache parts along the way.</p>

        <hr style="border: none; border-top: 2px solid #e0e0e0; margin: 3rem 0;">

        <h2>Preventive Maintenance Schedules</h2>

        <h3>Daily Checks (5-10 minutes)</h3>
        <p>Walk around the vehicle looking for fluid leaks underneath, check tire pressures and condition, verify all
            lights function, and look for loose items or new damage. Pop the hood and check fluid levels including oil,
            coolant, brake fluid, and power steering fluid. Listen for new noises when starting and while driving.</p>

        <h3>Weekly Maintenance (30-45 minutes)</h3>
        <p>Clean air filters if in dusty conditions, check battery terminals for corrosion, inspect for loose bolts on
            suspension, roof rack, and bumpers, examine tires closely for embedded objects or damage, grease chassis
            points if equipped with fittings, and check spare tire pressure. Top off washer fluid and inspect wiper
            blades.</p>

        <h3>Every 1,000 km or After Difficult Terrain</h3>
        <p>Inspect underneath for damage to skid plates, oil pan, transmission, and transfer case. Check for cracked
            welds on bumpers and roof racks. Examine shock absorbers for leaks. Tighten any loose bolts found during
            inspection, paying special attention to wheel lug nuts. Check differential and transfer case oil levels.
            Clean battery terminals and apply protective spray.</p>

        <h3>Standard Service Intervals</h3>
        <p>Follow your manufacturer's severe duty schedule, not normal intervals. Overlanding qualifies as severe duty.
            Change engine oil every 5,000 to 7,500 km depending on conditions. Replace fuel filters at half the normal
            interval, especially in regions with questionable fuel quality. Rotate tires every 10,000 km or when uneven
            wear appears. Inspect brakes every oil change. Change transmission and differential fluids at recommended
            intervals, not mileage, as rough terrain wears them faster.</p>

        <h3>Extended Service Tasks</h3>
        <p>Every major stop (monthly or at significant waypoints), drain and clean sediment from fuel tank if you've
            been running questionable fuel. Flush and replace coolant annually regardless of mileage. Service wheel
            bearings, repack with grease, and inspect for wear. Check and adjust valve clearances on engines that
            require it. Inspect CV boots and drive shaft joints for tears or leaks. Clean and re-grease sliding contact
            points on leaf springs.</p>

        <h3>Documentation and Records</h3>
        <p>Keep a detailed maintenance log noting dates, locations, and mileage for all service performed. Document all
            repairs with photos showing before, during, and after. This history helps diagnose recurring issues and
            proves valuable when selling. Note fuel quality at each fill-up to correlate with any fuel system problems.
            Record unusual noises or handling changes even if you can't identify the cause immediately.</p>

        <h3>Climate-Specific Adjustments</h3>
        <p>In hot, dusty environments, double the frequency of air filter cleaning and checks. In humid coastal areas,
            inspect electrical connections weekly for corrosion. In cold climates, check antifreeze protection levels
            regularly. In sandy conditions, drain breather tubes on axles and transmission frequently. In high-altitude
            regions, engine performance suffers and may need adjustment.</p>

        <h2>When to Call It: Knowing Your Limits</h2>

        <p>Some repairs are too dangerous or complex for field work. Cracked engine blocks, major transmission damage,
            destroyed wheel bearings, or severely damaged frames need professional facilities. Attempting certain
            repairs without proper tools can cause injury or make problems worse. Don't risk your safety trying to limp
            a severely damaged vehicle through dangerous terrain. Sometimes satellite rescue or professional recovery is
            the right choice.</p>
