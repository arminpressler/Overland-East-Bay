## Instructions
**This is just a guide - make it your own!**

Feel free to share as much or as little as you're comfortable with. Some members write detailed build logs, others just hit the highlights. Both are great!

- Skip sections that don't apply to you
- Add sections we haven't thought of
- Include links to products, resources, or tutorials that helped you
- Share photos, videos, build threads, or blog posts
- Keep it simple or go deep - it's your page
- Update it whenever you want (or don't!)

The goal is to share your story and connect with fellow overlanders. There's no right or wrong way to do this.
